# Employee-Salary-Calculation-using-Abstraction
Employee Salary Calculation using Abstraction
This project demonstrates Abstraction in Java by defining an Employee abstract class with a calculateSalary() method that is implemented by its subclasses. The program calculates salaries for Full-Time and Part-Time employees using concrete classes.

üìù About the Project
This project highlights:

Abstraction: The Employee class defines a template but does not implement calculateSalary().
Encapsulation: Employee attributes like name, empId, and salary-related fields are protected or private.
Polymorphism: Different types of employees implement their own salary calculations.
Scenario
FullTimeEmployee: Has a fixed monthly salary.
PartTimeEmployee: Salary is based on hours worked √ó hourly rate.
üöÄ Features
Uses Abstraction to enforce salary calculation for all employees.
Allows easy expansion to new types of employees in the future.
Demonstrates OOP principles like encapsulation and inheritance.
üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Programming Language: Java
IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code
